Title: The Legendary Blacksmith

Description:
This is a copy of my Final Project for Full Sail University as it existed on the last day of grading.
This game was created for the HTC Vive platform. The goal is to fill the role of town blacksmith and create weapons for your army.
Every weapon you create, when turned in to the correct vendor, spawns an army unit to fight against the enemy blacksmith.

Special Instructions:
You spawn in the main menu room. Here you can practice your interactions with some of the objects on the tables around the room.
You can try picking these objects up and touching them together to make one of the completed objects (sword, shield, or arrow).
Up the stairs you will see goblins interacting with various machines. These will be the machines you will interact with as the blacksmith.
Paying attention to how each of these machines are used will help you in the game. When you are ready to jump in, 
place the "blacksmith's smock" (the object featuring the game logo and located in front of the middle table) around your neck.
Once you load in, a voice will guide you through making the required items. When your item is made,
turn it in to the vendors located by your blacksmith's shop to create an army unit and watch as they run into battle!
