Title: Graphics 2 Project

Description:
The task set in front me for this project was to implement all of the 3D Graphics Programming 
skills and techniques I had learned in the previous course as well as research and apply new techniques.

Software Used:
Windows 10 (64-bit)
Visual Studios 2015
DirectX 11

Controls:
Quick Exit - Esc
**Press (TAB) to toggle the following**
Movement - WASD
Up -  Space
Down - Left Ctrl
Look Around - Mouse
Sprint - Left Shift
Move Point Light - IJKL

Time Taken:
1 Month

Features:
- 3D Rendering of Textured Models
- Camera Translation and Rotation
- Render to Texture (Used for Portals)
- Stencil Buffer (Used to avoid z-fighting on the Portals against the gray wall)
- Infinite Sky Box (Always visible. Doesn’t translate with camera movement)
- Directional Light (Blue light pointing down on the checkerboard ground
- Point Light (White light in the center of the stage. Can be moved with IJKL)
- Spot Light (Magenta light pointing forward moving with the camera’s position)
- OBJ File Loading (Rocks and Flashlight)
- Geometry Instancing (Multiple Rocks with one draw call)
- Vertex-based Color Mapping (Used to color the Star)
- Compute Shader (Used for the particle physics in the Red Box Fountain)
- 4x Multisample Anti-Aliasing - MSAA (Applied to all drawn geometry and the Portal’s Textures)
- Dynamic Window Resizing (All scene variables and buffers updated accordingly)
- Multiple Viewport Scenes (Used to render the Minimap in the top left corner)
