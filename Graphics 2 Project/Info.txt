Title: Graphics 2 Project

Description:
The task set in front me for this project was to implement all of the 3D Graphics Programming 
skills and techniques I had learned in the previous course as well as research and apply new techniques.

Software Used:
 - Windows 10 (64-bit)
 - Visual Studios 2015
 - DirectX 11

Controls:
 - Quick Exit - Esc
**Press (TAB) to toggle the following**
 - Camera Movement - WASD
 - Camera Up -  Space
 - Camera Down - Left Ctrl
 - Look Around - Mouse
 - Sprint - Left Shift
 - Point Light Movement - IJKL

Time Taken:
1 Month

Features:
 - 3D Rendering of Textured Models
 - Camera Translation and Rotation - See Controls
 - Render to Texture - Used for Portal views
 - Stencil Buffer - Used to avoid z-fighting on the Portals against the gray wall
 - Infinite Sky Box - Always visible. Doesn’t translate with camera movement
 - Directional Light - White light pointing diagonally down and forward
 - Point Light - Red light in the center of the stage. Can be moved. (See Controls)
 - Spot Light - Blue light pointing forward, moving with the camera’s position and orientation
 - OBJ File Loading - Rocks and Flashlight
 - Geometry Instancing - Multiple Rocks with one draw call
 - Vertex-based Color Mapping - Used to color the Star and Rainbow Boxes
 - Compute Shader - Used for the particle physics in the Rainbow Box Fountain
 - 4x Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) - Applied to all drawn geometry and the Portal views
 - Dynamic Window Resizing - All scene variables and buffers updated accordingly when resizing to any aspect ratio
 - Multiple Viewport Scenes - Used to render the Minimap in the top left corner
