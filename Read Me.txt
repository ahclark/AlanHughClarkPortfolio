Hello! My name is Alan Clark. Welcome to my portfolio!
In each of these folders you will find some of the projects I have worked on for the past few years.

Inside each folder you will find some of the following:
- Project folder containing the source code
- Folder containing an executable in the case there is a problem with building the project on your machine
- Video explaining what I worked on and description of the project.
- A text document describing relevant information about the project, its controls, and software used

Please note that if you do not find some of these items in the folder, it is either in development or is not applicable to the project.
If you have any questions or would otherwise like to contact me, please email me at alanhughclark@outlook.com
