Hello! My name is Alan Clark. Welcome to my portfolio!

In each of these folders you will find some of the projects I have worked on for the past few years.

Inside each folder will be a few items:
- A project folder containing source code
- A text document describing relevant information about the project, its controls, and required software/hardware
- An executable in the case there is a problem with building the project on your machine

If you have any questions or would otherwise like to contact me, please email me at alanhughclark@outlook.com.
